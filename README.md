This repository exists as a place for me to collect some thoughts I've been having recently on the certification of the authenticity of media.

# Abstract

Various neural network technologies appear to be able to already generate convincing images, audio, and video of events that didn't happen, or happened differently to their portrayl in that video. Soon that generated multimedia will become very difficult to distinguish from authentic recordings.

This changes the mental paradigm that possession of multimedia purporting to show an event means that even most likely occured -- seeing will no longer be believing.

Generation of fake multimedia already exists today, but its generation involves a lot of time and work, so authentic media occurs far more regularly than faked media. The work needed to generate this media is likely to diminish significantly in the next few years.

Some form of certifying and then authenticating multimedia would be helpful.

A photographer can already create a digital signature for their work using public/private keys. However, there's no central repository for these signatures, and no infrastructure for verifying them. Further, the general public is unlikely to recognize the names of individual photographers -- it would be useful to have a web of trust where provenance of media can be recorded, and where institutional certifiers of multimedia can also signal their trust in the multimedia. If a newspaper publishes an image, or a speech, they're (usually) signalling that they believe it to be authentic. This information may well be useful to a consumer of the media trying to find out more about it.

Follows a brain dump that will hopefully coalesce into something more substantial with time...
